 OOPS I SCREWED UP SO I MADE NEW FILE NEW FILE
 
 //AHH THIS NEW FILE IS FAILING TO LOAD THE MODEL I DON'T GET WHY
 
 OLd notes:
 
 GENERAL NOTES:
 
 The set up student input part is a mess of views and text inputs because it was the only way I knew to keep the interface in control, anyone who cares to undo that mess is welcome to do so
    It's also not very flexible for other ipads, make the constraints less dependent on x and y positions
 
 
 todo
    FIX CONSTRAINTS
 
 Cool Features to add
    Delete/undo for the transcript
    Figure out how to bold names, on a copy of this file so you don't break anything
    change the contribution buttons within the app, make it dependent on the class
 
 
 
 fix that extra space when adding classes that the non-completely dismissed keyboard keeps
