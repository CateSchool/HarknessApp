 OLd notes:
 
 GENERAL NOTES:
 
 The set up student input part is a mess of views and text inputs because it was the only way I knew to keep the interface in control, anyone who cares to undo that mess is welcome to do so
 It's also not very flexible for other ipads,
 
 
 todo
    add the keyboard
    FIX CONSTRAINTS
 
 Features to add
    Delete/undo for the transcript
    Figure out the bold stuff, on a copy of this file so you don't break anything
